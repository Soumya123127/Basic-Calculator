# Python Basic Terminal Calculator
An interactive command-line calculator written in Python that supports multiple and pairwise operations. Designed for flexibility, clarity, and a smooth user experience with support for multi-input addition and multiplication.

# Features
- Add as many numbers as you like.
- Multiply multiple values in a single go.
- Subtract, Divide and Modulo operations for two values.
- Graceful handling of invalid inputs and division by zero.
- Lists and tuples used for clean structure and efficient logic.

# How It Works
1. You select an operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, or `%`.
2. If you choose `+` or `*`, you're prompted to enter multiple numbers separated by spaces.
3. For `-`, `/`, or `%`, the calculator requests two specific numbers.
4. The calculator performs the chosen operation and prints the result.
5. Youâ€™re prompted to run another calculation or quit.

# Usage
Run the script: python calculator.py
